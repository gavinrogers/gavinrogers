* The Problem
** As app builders, developers need tools and packages
In order to quickly bootstrap an eosystem of *quality* software, it will be necessary to build on top of excellent libraries

  - Data manipulation
  - API libraries: 
  - Dependancy management can be a nightmare
  - 
* [#B] Existing package management
  - npm [[https://npm.github.io/how-npm-works-docs/npm3/non-determinism.html][not designed to be deterministic]]
  - gx-go
  - CPAN
  - dpkg
  - rpm
The problem with these tools is they can't guarantee the contents of a zome because they are not deterministic

** Existing configuration management
  - puppet
  - chef
* Functional Solutions
** Determinism
What do we mean by a deterministic package manager? "Determinism is the philosophical theory that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes."

  - yarn [[https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/31/determinism/][Yarn Determinism]]
  - npm (after version 5.0) 
* Implimentation
